        "What is Email?\n",
        "\n",
        "“Email” stands for electronic mail. It is the message distributed by electronic means among computer users in a network. An email will be sent from one user and can be distributed to many. The email was initially first used in the 1960s. It took its current form in the 1970s. In fact, some earlier systems required both the sender and receiver to be online which is similar to how instant messaging works today.\n",
